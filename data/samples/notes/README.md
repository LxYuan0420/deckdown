# notes — Input Spec (optional feature)

Create a small deck with 1–2 slides and add speaker notes:

- Slide 1 (Title: "Notes")
  - Notes: "Confidential: internal only"

- Slide 2 (Title: "More")
  - Notes: "Next steps: ship M1"

Save as `notes.pptx` in this folder.

Intended Markdown (once notes are implemented):
- Per slide, include a `### Notes` section with the notes text (subject to redaction rules).
